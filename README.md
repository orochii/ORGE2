SDL game engine thing for simple 2D games with tilemaps and sprites and stuff.

This is a small project meant to be a simple 2D game made for fun to run on my RG350. I.e. it should run on anything from Windows to Linux, and OpenDingux consoles like GCWZero, Dingoo and/or RG350.
I'm attempting something pretty similar in structure to ASCII/Enterbrain/Kadokawa's RPG Maker series, more specifically the RPG Maker XP/VX/Ace incarnations.

Right now there is some code for scenes and on screen sprites, and some audio/input/file simple management done.

TODO:
- Tilemaps (Tiled support).
- Scenario structure.
- Interactables.
